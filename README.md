My first website ever published to the internet

# This site doesn't work at all. 
I tried to make a script that got rid of the php and converted everything to html, but it didn't work as I'm sure you can tell by opening the link above. I'll fix it later

This site was something I made the summer following my sophemore year. I had just taken a very introductory web design class at my high school and instantly saw myself as ready to make anything.

As you can see from the looks of the page, that wasn't exactly the case at the time. But it was definitely a starting point.
