My first website ever published to the internet

This site was something I made the summer following my sophemore year. I had just taken a very introductory web design class at my high school and instantly saw myself as ready to make anything.

As you can see from the looks of the page, that wasn't exactly the case at the time. But it was definitely a starting point.
